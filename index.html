                This bible reading plan provides you the most flexibility in choosing how to read the bible.  Read as many chapters 
                or verses as you want each day.  There is no pressure.  If you miss a day or don't finish reading for the day, no 
                worries, your plan will be waiting for you to pick up where you left off when you are ready (Don't wait too long, 
                though.  The longer you wait, the harder it will be to pick it back up again).  Your goal should be to know the only 
                true living God and Jesus Christ whom he has sent (John 17:3), developing your relationship with him, not sticking 
                to a specific reading plan.  So, take your time.  Learn to enjoy spending time with God in his word.  You have a 
                lifetime to spend with him, and an eternity afterwards.

                There are many plans and devotions out there that hit specific topics, and they are 
                useful, but "All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training 
                in righteousness; so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work."  (2 Timothy 3:16-17)  My 
                fear is that many of today's Christians have a limited view and knowledge of God because they only do "popcorn" 
                plans and devotions that interest them, and only get a one-sided view of God as a result.

            <h2>
                Why read the entire bible?  
            </h2>
            <h2>
                Why a new reading plan?  
            </h2>
            <P>   
                I haven't found one that allows the flexibility that I am looking for to choose how to read the bible.
